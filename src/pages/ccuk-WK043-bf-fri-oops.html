      <p class="text-center">Hi {{user.first_name}}. This morning, you will have received our Big Black Friday Deal email but I made a mistake in it which may cause confusion. This follow-up email is to clarify the following:<br><br>From today until Monday, you receive <strong>25&#37; OFF when you buy ANY 2 products online</strong>, not the 20&#37; discount we mentioned in a couple of places in that last email.<br><br>I am so sorry for any confusion and if you do need help of any kind today, please reply to this email to discuss it with us here in the Customer Services department. Or call us for free on <strong>0808 178 1344</strong>.</p>
